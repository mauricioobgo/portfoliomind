"""Strategy signals — technical + news sentiment → single score (card 6).

Public surface:

* :func:`score_ticker` — single-ticker entry point. **Never raises**;
  failures are returned as :class:`Signal` with ``error`` set.
* :func:`score_universe` — full 45-ticker universe, sorted by
  ``combined`` descending.
* :class:`Signal` / :class:`TechnicalScore` — the dataclasses cards
  7/8 will import.
* :func:`compute_technical_score` — pure-math technical score from a
  list of closes. Useful for backtests / unit tests.
* :class:`TechnicalCache` — same-day idempotency layer.

The technical layer is yfinance (6 months of daily bars); the
sentiment layer is card 5's :func:`score_ticker_sentiment`. The two
are combined with weights 0.6 / 0.4 (technicals dominate) and the
result is bounded to [-1, +1]. Confidence is the magnitude of the
combined signal times the agreement of the two sub-scores — a
signal where the components contradict each other has near-zero
confidence and should be filtered out before any operator-facing
ping.

Idempotency: a re-run in the same Bogota day returns identical
:class:`Signal` objects for every ticker (cache hit). A run after
midnight Bogota triggers a fresh yfinance fetch + (if not cached)
a fresh LLM sentiment call.

Design constraints (from the card 6 spec):

* No raw OHLCV at INFO log level; DEBUG only.
* **Never raise** from :func:`score_ticker` / :func:`score_universe`.
* yfinance is the only network call; one batched fetch per ticker
  per day (cache hit on re-runs).
* yfinance returning insufficient history → ``Signal(error="insufficient
  history")`` with ``combined=0.0``.
